    "**DataSet Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for `h1n1_vaccine` and one for `seasonal_vaccine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two target variables:\n",
    "    - `h1n1_vaccine` - Whether respondent received H1N1 flu vaccine.\n",
    "    - `seasonal_vaccine` - Whether respondent received seasonal flu vaccine.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Both are binary variables: `0 = No` and `1 = Yes`. Some respondents didn't get either vaccine, others got only one, and some got both. This is formulated as a multilabel (and not multiclass) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset has 36 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `respondent_id` - is unique and a random identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `h1n1_concern` - Level of concern about the H1N1 flu.\n",

    "    * `2 = A lot of Knowledge`\n",
